# Buffy-Quote-Generator

This is a project that my wife and I are working on for three reasons. The first reason is that we both love the show. the second reason is because it is something we can create together and anything we can accomplish together makes our relationship stronger. The third reason is because I am working hard to become a front-end web developer, and javascript is still (in September 2020) very difficult for me. This website gives me an opportunity to practice on a project that I thought of, designed, built, and launched. It is a small and simple website with code that is probably considered "easy" for the average programmer. For me, it has been a great learning experience to build something from scratch. 

### HTML
The html for this project is very simple. I started with the basic html skeleton:

## <!DOCTYPE html>
## <html lang="en">
## <head>
##    <meta charset="UTF-8">
##    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
##    <title>Document</title>
## </head>
## <body>
##    
## </body>
## </html>

I added a div with a class of wrapper in which the rest of the body content will reside. Inside that div, I included an h1 tag for the site title and a button that is used
